# Human-Activity-Classification-Using-Smartphone-Data

This project focuses on human activity classification using 3-axis acceleration data collected from a smartphone. The data is gathered for three activities: Sitting, Walking, and Jogging, with each activity recorded in five trials, each lasting approximately 10-12 seconds. The sampling frequency for data collection is set at 10 Hz. 

The raw acceleration data is processed using MATLAB to extract meaningful features such as mean, root mean square (RMS), and standard deviation from the x, y, and z axes. The data is segmented into training and testing sets, and feature extraction is performed on a sliding window basis with various window lengths and increments. 

The extracted features are used to train and test machine learning models for activity classification. Key skills involved in this project include:
- Data collection using mobile sensors (smartphone accelerometer).
- Signal processing in MATLAB, including time-series analysis and feature extraction.
- Application of machine learning techniques for activity classification.

By processing the raw accelerometer data and training a classifier, the project aims to achieve accurate human activity recognition.
